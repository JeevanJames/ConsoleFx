## To-do

[X] Flatten out the `SelectSingleSettings` class.
[X] Retain only the "global" settings in the `SelectXXXSettings` classes and move usage-specific settings (like `StartingIndex`) to method parameters.
[ ] Support for separators in the `SelectXXX` methods
[ ] Support for showing select lists at a specific/current indent
[X] Complete `ProgressBar` implementation
[ ] Separate `CColor` into two enums, one for foreground colors and one for background
[ ] See if the progress bar can have a way to span the width of the screen
